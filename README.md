# Stroke-Classifcation

The dataset comprises over a thousand high-resolution whole-slide digital pathology images. Each slide depicts a blood clot from a patient that had experienced an  acute ischemic stroke.

The slides comprising the training and test sets depict clots with an etiology (that is, origin) known to be either CE (Cardioembolic) or LAA (Large Artery Atherosclerosis). We include a set of supplemental slides with a either an unknown etiology or an etiology other than CE or LAA.
